# Visual Exploration of Cortical Cell Expressiveness in Neural Pathways
Team Members: Landon Dyken, Raja Kandadi, and Farah Kamleh

Client: Christian Puzzo, Technician/RA in the Department of Neurobiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham

In this repository, we provide a system for visualizing differences in cortical cell expressiveness within neural pathways. We use Three.js to load and visually compare data between different cell expressiveness images. 

Credits: The code in this repo was built from a template project created by Andrew Wentzel, a member of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory, as teaching support for UIC's CS529 Visual Data Science course.
